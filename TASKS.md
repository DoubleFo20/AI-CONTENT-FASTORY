## Parallel ownership contract

Root: all governance/progress docs, shared/, server/ai/, package manifests/lockfiles,
configs, schema definitions, tooling, Git and integration. Core writer: server/ except
server/ai/ and Root-owned schema/contracts. Web writer: src/, public/ except Root manifest/
service worker assets. QA: tests/ only; server and client are read-only review targets.
All writers use isolated worktrees within ignored .worktrees/. Git operations remain Root-only.
Root reviews and copies owned paths into main after writers finish, then runs combined checks.

For the completed design request, Root owned DESIGN_SYSTEM/UX_FLOW/I18N, handoff/progress,
preview server and integration. Design-prototype agent owned docs/design/index.html/studio.css/
studio.js/README.md; specs agent owned UI_SPEC/MOTION_SPEC; QA agent owned MOBILE_UX/VISUAL_QA
and performed independent read-only review. Each writer used an isolated design worktree.
Root added final corrections and measured the browser; production src/server/shared stayed untouched.
